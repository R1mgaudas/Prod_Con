#Concurrency collections and patterns

You have 1000 files with random numbers. When using n threads (n should be possible to be adjusted live), filter out only primary numbers when showing real-time statistics:
1. Number of threads
2. Number of files done
3. Max and Min found primary number

In this task you must use concurrent collections and producer - consumer pattern.
